Hey!

The Cruze Crew brand was founded by four members (Jordan, Rebecca, Aliya and Erin). We spent the better part of our summer in 2018 meeting up at our local library to come up with a buisness idea. Some afternoons we'd hit up the nearby skatepark, where we learned to skateboard. Several weeks in we finally landed on an idea. We founded Cruze Crew that day, an apperal brand centered around our love for longboarding and skateboarding.

Some of us have went our sperate ways, but I hope this site lasts far into the future to serve as a reminder of our friendship.
